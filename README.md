The Spotify Web API requires an active Spotify instance running on your local machine because it relies on the Spotify Connect functionality. Spotify Connect allows users to control playback on one device from another device using the Spotify app. Therefore, to interact with the Spotify Web API, a valid Spotify instance needs to be active on your local machine to establish a connection and perform operations through the API.

Important Notice: This project requires an active Spotify instance running on your local machine for proper functionality. Please ensure that you have the Spotify desktop or mobile app installed and logged in before proceeding. To establish a connection, please play a song on your local Spotify app. Once a song is playing, you will be able to fully interact with this project, control playback, and access additional features. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
